## Opening Quote

> "There is no end to education.
> It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education.
> The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning."
>
> — Jiddu Krishnamurti

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this video you will be able to:
- Define and understand the concept of **metacognition** and its importance in the learning process
- Recognise the significance of **feedback** and **active engagement** in enhancing comprehension and retention
- Illustrate the role of **attention** in alerting, filtering and emphasising relevant data during learning
- Explain different perspectives on **sleep** and its role in consolidation of information

## What is Learning? (Cognitive Science)

**Learning is the process by which experiences lead to long-lasting new knowledge or behaviour.**

## What Are the Factors That Encourage Human Learning?

### The Most Effective Strategy to Improve Learning

**Learning-to-Learn (Meta-cognition)**

- Identifying specific strategies for planning, monitoring, and evaluating your own learning
- Develop a repertoire of strategies to choose from and the skills to select the most suitable strategy for a given learning task

#### Self-Regulated Learning Components

Self-regulated learning can be broken into three essential components:

1. **Cognition** – the mental process involved in knowing, understanding, and learning
2. **Metacognition** – often defined as 'learning to learn'
3. **Motivation** – willingness to engage our metacognitive and cognitive skills

## Learning from Feedback

### Key Principles

- **Learning is faster when we receive quick and detailed error feedback** (supervised learning)
- **Regularly testing your knowledge (retrieval practice) is one of the best ways to ensure learning**
  - Testing allows attention to be focused on weaker areas
  - Most students choose to reread notes instead of testing their memory (flashcards)

### How Feedback is Given is Crucial

- Harsh or overly negative feedback can impair learning (if it induces too much stress/anxiety)

**Reference:** Wisniewski et al., *Frontiers in Psychology*, 2020

## Quiz Question 1 (Blackboard)

**How we learn (cog sci) – question 1**

Are exam results an effective form of feedback for learning? Why?

---

## Inattentional Blindness

[Reference to "WHODUNNIT?" image from Transport for London, Daniel Simons & colleagues]

**Inattentional blindness** demonstrates how we can fail to notice unexpected stimuli when our attention is focused elsewhere, highlighting the critical importance of attention in learning.

---

## Attention

### Definition (Cognitive Science)

**Attention is the mechanism by which the brain selects and enhances relevant information while filtering out distractions.**

### Major Attention Systems

According to **Michael Posner**, there are several major attention systems:

1. **Alerting:** pay attention now!
2. **Orienting:** focus on this, not that!
3. **Executive attention:** do this, then that!

### Shared Attention

**Shared attention** (paying attention to other's attention):
- Accelerates learning in young children
- Involved in some of the most effective teaching interventions:
  - Collaborative learning
  - Peer tutoring

## Active Engagement - Proposing & Testing Hypotheses

### How the Brain Learns

To learn, our brain must first:
1. Form a mental 'model' of the world
2. Compare its predictions to the sensory information it receives

### Requirements for Learning

- Requires **attention, effort, testing hypotheses and reflection**
- **Deeper thinking, better memory**
  - "Requiring students to engage more cognitive effort often leads to enhanced retention."
  - **Zaromb, Karpicke & Roediger, 2010**

### Evidence from STEM Education

Across STEM disciplines, **active engagement leads to:**
- More understanding
- Higher test scores
- Fewer students failing (compared to lectures)

**Reference:** Freeman et al., *PNAS*, 2014

**Key Finding:** Active engagement significantly reduces failure rates and increases performance across all STEM disciplines (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Geology, Math, Physics, Psychology, Overall).

## Quiz Question 2 (Blackboard)

**How we learn (cog sci) – question 2**

**Context:** An unguided environment is one in which learners, rather than being presented with essential information, must discover or construct essential information for themselves.

**Question:** Given the apparent benefits of active learning over traditional lecturing, do you think people learn best in an unguided environment? Why?

---

## Active Engagement – Curiosity and Laughter

### Curiosity

- **Curiosity occurs whenever we detect a gap between what we want to know and what we already know** (Loewenstein, 1994)
- Curiosity is driven by the **value of acquiring information**
- **Greater curiosity is associated with greater academic achievement** (Shah et al., 2018)

### Laughter

- We laugh when we discover one of our assumptions is wrong, forcing us to change our mental model
- **Laughter increases curiosity and subsequent memory** (Esseily et al., *Cognition & Emotion*, 2016)
- Laughter is a contagious social response that spreads as we draw each other's attention to an unexpected piece of information (Hurley, Dennett & Adams, 2011)

**Example:** Neil deGrasse Tyson (astrophysicist & science communicator) - "Kids are born scientists."

## Quiz Question 3 (Blackboard)

**How we learn (cog sci) – question 3**

- Which aspects of active engagement do you think current machine learning uses?
- Could incorporating other aspects be useful? Why?

---

## Consolidation

### Definition

**Consolidation is the process of change from slow, conscious, effortful processing to fast, unconscious, automatic expertise.**

### The Role of Sleep

- A lot of consolidation occurs during sleep
- **More sleep → stronger memories & better generalisation**
- Sleep strengthens existing knowledge, but also **inspires insight**

### Sleep and Insight

**Wagner et al., *Nature*, 2004** demonstrated that sleep significantly enhances insight (P = 0.014 and P = 0.009 in different conditions), showing that sleep after learning improved performance compared to waking intervals.

### Dreams and Learning

**Question:** Are dreams fabricated data to help brain training?

**Reference:** Dehaene, 2020

## Recap

**Learning is the process by which experiences lead to long-lasting new knowledge or behaviour**

### Most Effective Ways to Promote Human Learning

1. **Learning about learning** (metacognition)
2. **High quality, rapid feedback**
   - Retrieval practice
3. **Active engagement**
   - Proposing and testing hypotheses
   - Curiosity
   - Humour
4. **Paying attention**
5. **Learning socially**
6. **Sleeping well** (consolidating information)
