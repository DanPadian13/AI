## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this video you will be able to:
- Make a reasoned argument to answer:
  - Why is some information maintained in memory, while other things are forgotten?
- Describe the various types of memory, and their timescales

## What is Memory? (Cognitive Science)

Memory is the capacity to:
- **encode** - sending information into storage (for future use)
- **store** - maintaining information over time
- **retrieve** - recalling previously encoded information from storage (fill in the blanks)

---

## The Processes of Human Memory

### Encoding
- Sending information into storage (for future use)

### Storage
- Maintaining information over time

### Retrieval
- Recalling previously encoded information from storage (fill in the blanks)

## The Purpose of Human Memory

> "We have been wrong about memory: it is not a system which is oriented towards the past, but one whose role is to send data to the future, so we may later access it." - Stanislas Dehaene

- The brain must estimate which information could be useful in the future, and send that to the storage
- Sending information from a temporary memory state to a longer-term store is called **encoding**

## Memory Timescales and Types

### Sensory Memory
- **Duration:** Tens to hundreds of milliseconds (<1s)
- Also called **iconic memory**
- Example: Brief visual flash retention
- Source: Pieter Roelfsema lab, Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience

### Working/Short-term Memory
- **Duration:** Seconds to tens of seconds (1-30s)
- **Conscious/Explicit** processing
- Example: Remembering a one-time code
  - "Remember this one-time code: 841347"
  - "Don't remember this: 198322"
  - "What was the one-time code?"

**Two Forms:**
1. **Working memory** (1-30s) - Explicit/conscious
2. **Short-term memory** (1-30s) - Implicit/unconscious

### Long-term Memory
- **Duration:** Days to decades (up to several decades)
- Information encoded from working/short-term memory
- Both explicit/conscious and implicit/unconscious pathways

---

## Types of Long-Term Memory

### 1. Episodic Memory
- **Type:** Explicit/conscious
- **Definition:** Memory of specific personal experiences and events
- **Example:** "What is your first memory of being outside your home town or country?"

### 2. Semantic Memory
- **Type:** Explicit/conscious
- **Definition:** General knowledge and facts
- **Example:** "What is the population of Bristol?"

### 3. Procedural Memory
- **Type:** Implicit/unconscious
- **Definition:** Memory for skills and procedures
- **Example:** "Please enter your password (on a frequently used device)"

    ├── Episodic memory [Explicit/conscious]
    ├── Semantic memory [Explicit/conscious]
    └── Procedural memory [Implicit/unconscious]

Short-term memory (1-30s) [Implicit/unconscious]

## Quiz Question

**Encoding into long-term memory** (on Blackboard)

Do you think you are likely to encode the one-time code (presented earlier) in your long-term memory? Please justify your response.

---

## Recap

Memory can be divided in several ways:

### By Timescale
- Sensory
- Short-term/working
- Long-term

### By the Involvement of Consciousness
- Explicit
- Implicit

### By Amount of Generalization from Original Experience
- Episodic
- Semantic

**Key Insight:** Memory may be thought of as a future-oriented function
- Which information should I make available to the future (i.e., encode)?
